smartDM: Sream Data Mining Library for C++.
=================

smartDM implements extremely fast streaming decision trees in C++ for big data streams.

The main advantages of smartDM over other C/C++ data stream libraries are the following:

- Evaluation and learners are separated, not linked together.
- It contains several methods for learning numeric attributes.
- It is easy to extend and add new methods.
- The adaptive decision tree is more accurate and does not need an expert user to choose optimal parameters to use.  
- It contains powerful ensemble methods. 
- It is much faster and uses less memory.
